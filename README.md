To win a tournament, must try and get the maximum points and the No. I rank among other participants. This project provides an insight as it first develops the design of the UI of the main window required for the project, then it provide the event driven handling of the signals by the slots designed for the project. Then the designed UI works on the cricket teams that we make by creating new team, then we can modify the playing TEAM! team and save it. It also ensures the overall score of the players of the team by all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. The project has a predefined database in which all the data we created and save the team data.
